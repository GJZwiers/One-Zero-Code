## Booleans

True or not true? That's exactly what boolean values are about: a value that is either `true` or `false`.

## Strings


### Samples - String Interpolation
```javascript
var age = 5;
console.log(`Angie is ${age} years old`);
```

Python
```python

print(f'Angie is {age} years old')
```

C#
```csharp
int age = 5;
Console.WriteLine($"Angie is {age} years old");
```

Rust
```rust
let age: i32 = 5;
println!("Angie is {} years old", age);
```
