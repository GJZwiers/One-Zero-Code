## Welcome to One Zero Code
This site is for people looking to learn computer programming. It teaches the core concepts found in almost all of the languages most used today and shows their similarities as well as their differences. Although this sets the bar a bit higher if you are completely new to coding, it can enable you to become a skilled programmer fast. Four languages are used to show code examples: Python, JavaScript, C#. They cover the language spectrum pretty well in terms of style and syntax.
