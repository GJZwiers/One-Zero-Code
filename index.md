## Welcome to One Zero Code
This project contains guides for learning the common concepts and principles in computer programming. It is not specific to any language, though different language samples are used to illuminate each topic.

### Fundamentals
##### Learn how to write programs in any language
1. [Coding with Basics](programming.md)

2. [Introducing Data Types](data.md)

4. [Using Arrays and Objects](arrays-and-objects.md)

5. [Handling Errors](errors.md)

### Abstractions
##### Learn how to create abstractions to design more flexible and reusable code
1. [Organizing Related Code in Classes](oop.md)

2. [Designing Advanced Class Relationships]()

3. [Interchanging Parts with Object Interfaces](interchangeable-parts.md)

4. [Applying Design Patterns](design-patterns.md)

### Application Maintenance
##### Learn how to improve existing code, keep and update versions and write down how your code works
1. [Refactoring Code](refactoring.md)

2. [Controlling Versions](versioning.md)

3. [Writing Documentation](documenting.md)

### User-Computer Interfaces
##### Learn how to abstract complex logic in simpler forms and commands
1. [Interacting with Terminals](terminals.md)

2. [Designing Application Programming Interfaces](apis.md)

3. [Creating Command Line Interfaces](clis.md)


### Low-Level Programming
##### Learn how high-level languages work under the hood
