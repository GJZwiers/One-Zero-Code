2. [Introducing Data Types](data.md)

4. [Using Arrays and Objects](arrays-and-objects.md)

5. [Handling Errors](errors.md)

### Abstractions
##### Learn how to create abstractions to design more flexible and reusable code
1. [Organizing Related Code in Classes](oop.md)

2. [Designing Advanced Class Relationships]()

3. [Interchanging parts with Object Interfaces](interchangeable-parts.md)

4. [Applying Design Patterns](design-patterns.md)

### Application Maintenance
##### Learn how to improve existing code, keep and update versions and write down how your code works
1. [Refactoring Code](refactoring.md)

2. [Controlling Versions](versioning.md)

3. [Writing Documentation](documenting.md)

### User-Computer Interfaces
##### Learn how to abstract complex logic in simpler forms and commands
1. [Interacting with Terminals](terminals.md)
