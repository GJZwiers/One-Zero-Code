# Using Code Libraries and Software Frameworks

## Libraries
Libraries contain code written by other programmers that can be used by others. Some libraries contain general-purpose utility code for doing common tasks a bit faster. Other libraries specialize in certain areas, for example displaying PDF files in a web browser.

## Frameworks
Application frameworks contain a selection of generic components for running software that programmers can then tailor to their specific needs. They generally take more control over program flow than libraries. In addition, they are targeted at specific types of applications, such as a web app, scientific simulation or financial model.
