# Languages used in this Book

Statically typed languages favor performance while dynamically typed ones favor flexibility. Nowadays, there is much overlap between high-level languages in the sense that they provide constructs to allow developers to code in a more static or a more dynamic way. 


### JavaScript
The most used language on the web today, JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. In recent years it has evolved fast from small website scripting to full-fledged web apps, server-side solutions and even desktop applications.

### Python
The most popular language for learning to code as well as data science and analytics. It trades speed for readability.

### C#
A statically typed language firmly grounded in object-oriented programming style.

### Rust
A relatively new language designed for performance and security. It is syntactically more difficult than the others, but offers highly precise controls for memory management and multithreading.


## Standardization without Unification
In recent times many high-level programming languages have converged to some extent. JavaScript developers can make use of static typing and object-oriented features through its superset TypeScript. C# Developers make use of the `dynamic` and `var` keywords to code more flexibly. This might raise the question as to why there is not some form of standard programming language.  
Firstly, all high-level languages do get converted into the same thing eventually: binary machine code with nothing but 0s and 1s. Although binary is powerful through its simplicity, it is just not practical to write code for contemporary programs in bits and bytes.  
Secondly, there are security advantages to having a multitude of languages. Diversity breeds resilience, so to speak. Imagine if every piece of software was written the same way and then at some point in time a major security flaw was discovered. In this case literally all applications that are in some form connected to the Web (which is almost all) would be unsafe to use, perhaps for a long time, depending on the difficulty of fixing the issue. On the other hand, in a system with many different languages, only a portion would be affected whilst most applications could carry on running as normal.  
Thirdly, different people have different tastes. Some programmers simply prefer to code in a certain languages out of comfort and/or habit.  
Fourthly, there would be issues with legacy code. If all the world decided to adopt a standard language tomorrow, nearly every code library in use would have to be ported to this language, a massive undertaking. In addition, infrequently used codebases might be forgotten and lost if no one decided to convert them.
