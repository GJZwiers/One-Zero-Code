# Application Levels

When programmers write code in languages such as Python or Rust, that code is not yet ready to be run by a computer. Strange as it may sound, high-level programming languages are meant for human eyes. To run code it has to be translated to a form that a Central Processing Unit (CPU) can work with. This format is called binary and its smallest unit is a bit which can have a value of 0 or 1. Bits are organised in bytes which consist of 8 bits. Larger collections of bytes are called kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes and terabytes. 

Two types of programs convert code to binary form: compilers and interpreters. The former converts all the code to binary before running any of it, while the latter converts and runs it one line at a time.
