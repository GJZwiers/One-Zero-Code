The smallest unit in computing can hold the value `0` or `1`. It is called a **bit** (**b**inary dig**it**) and forms the basis for the **binary** computer system. Linear sequences of bits can be used to represent information. Just a single bit can represent _true_ as 0 and _false_ as 1, a boolean value. For every bit we add to a sequence the number of possibilities increases by a power of two. Two bits can hold 2<sup>2</sup> = 4 values. Eight bits hold 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 values. In fact, this 8-bit sequence is called a **byte** and has become the standard way of organising computer memory.

Modern computers have room for a lot of bytes. The average hard-drive can store at least 1 Terabyte (TB) of data or 10<sup>12</sup> bytes.
