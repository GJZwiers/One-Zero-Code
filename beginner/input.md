# Give Me A Number - User Input

Before we move on to data types let's find out how we can let a user give some input to a program. Thus far we have been coding console programs that run on the little black window and we have been using `print` a lot to show a program's _output_.

We can give _input_ on the console to a Python program with the `input` function:
```python
number = input("Please enter a number: ")
print("Your number was: ", number)
```
If we run this, the program will prompt us with the text given in `input` and do nothing until we enter some number. It will then show the number we picked on the screen with the text in `print`.
