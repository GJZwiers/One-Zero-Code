# Installing an Editor

> In this section you will learn how to install an editor and how to make a directory for your coding projects.

To create a program the first thing required, computer aside, is a place to write the code. As we saw in the previous section we could use something as simple as Notepad but usually it is better to use an **editor**. Using an editor makes life easier because it comes with features to help you write code faster and in a more organized way.

For this course we will use Visual Studio Code, an editor by Microsoft suitable for all kinds of different languages. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

Once you have it installed it is also a good idea to make a directory to keep all your code projects in. Programmers often call this folder `repos` which stands for `repositories`. There are two ways we can make it, through the Windows UI or via the Command Line. I will show both, choose the one you prefer.

### Option 1: Make a Directory with the Windows UI
Open the File Explorer and click on the C: drive, click Users, then click on the folder with your username. Right click -> New -> Folder and fill in 'repos'. Press Enter and go into the new folder.

### Option 2: Make a Directory with the Command Line
Open the Command Prompt by pressing the Windows Start button on the keyboard or clicking on Start. Search for 'CMD' and select the Command Prompt. By default you should be in `C:\Users\[YOUR_USERNAME]`, if not change to it by typing `cd C:\Users\[YOUR_USERNAME]`. Now type `mkdir repos`. `mkdir` stands for `m`a`k`e `dir`ectory and `repos` is what we want to name it. If you see no warning or error messages all went well and you can go into the new directory with `cd repos`.

Is one of the above better than the other? It depends. Using the UI is more user-friendly and intuitive and works just fine for making a single directory. But, if you need to do something _repeatedly_ and/or _regularly_, using the Command Line can be very powerful. Also, it makes you feel more like a hacker :)
