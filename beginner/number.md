# Numbers

In Python we write numbers as we would normally, without any special syntax.

```python
one = 1
```

In programming whole numbers are called _integers_ and numbers with a decimal point are called _floating-point numbers_ or _floats_.

```python
one_float = 1.0
```

We can do basic arithmetic with a few _operators_, such as __+__, `-`, `*` and `/`.

```python
three = 1 + 2
one = 2 - 1
two = 1 * 2
half = 1 / 2
```

We can also raise a number to the power of _n_ with the exponent operator __**__:
```python
two_squared = 2**2
```

Finally, there is the _modulus_ operator `%`. This will give us the remainder after division. For example, when we divide 3 by 2 the remainder is 1.
```python
remainder = 3 % 2
```

Note that operators can have a different meaning when used with different types.
As we have seen, `+` can be used on both numbers and strings but uses a different way to add each of them together.

> Practice: Make a program that calculates your age in seconds and prints the result to the console.

<!-- ```python
age = 29
age_in_seconds = age * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60
``` -->
