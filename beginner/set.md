# Ready, Set, Store - Sets

The final collection we will be looking at is a set. Sets are _unordered_ and _unachangeable_ and do not allow duplicate values.

Sets are useful when we want to declare a list of unique values, such as the days of the week. We declare a set with curly braces but unlike dictionaries there are no key-value pairs, just values.
```python
days_of_the_week = {"monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday"}
```
