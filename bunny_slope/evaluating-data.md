# Evaluating Data

How is program data other than booleans compared for equality? Basically by _casting_ these values as booleans. Programming languages have rules for how this goes. For example, an empty string `""` is considered `false` by Python in logical statements. The values `True` and `False` in fact correspond to the numbers `1` and `0` respectively.
