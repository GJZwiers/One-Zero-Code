# Build Your Own Function

We have been using various _functions_ thus far, including `print`, `upper` and `range`. There are many more built-in functions in Python, but we can also make our own. To start with, we can declare a function by using the keyword `def` (which stands for `define`) and give the function a name:
```python
def myFunction:
    # 
```
