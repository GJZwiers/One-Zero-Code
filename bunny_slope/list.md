# Store All The Things! - Lists

If we need to store many values in Python we can declare a list. The following code creates an empty list by writing brackets `[]` and stores it in a variable `myList`:
```python
myList = []
```
We can also initialize a list with values:
```python
animals = ["Cat", "Dog", "Fish"]
```
