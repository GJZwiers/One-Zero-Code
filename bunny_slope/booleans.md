# Booleans

A special kind of data type in computers is a Boolean. This is a value that can be either **true** or **false**. Booleans are used for all sorts of logical operations in programming. Let's start by declaring a Boolean variable:
```python
happy = True
```

For clarity, programmers sometimes name boolean variables by starting their names with `is` or `has`. This helps other programmers to spot Boolean values in code. For example, the previous sample would have been written like so:
```python
isHappy = True
```

These Boolean values are at the basis of any kind of program logic, which we will look at next.
