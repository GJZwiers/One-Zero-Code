# Language Setups
Coming Soon

> On this page we discuss the steps needed to get started with one of the programming languages of this course.

This course uses four different languages to show programming concepts through examples. To practice I recommend starting with one of them and using the other ones for making comparisons when learning the concepts. This page will show how to setup a coding environment in the editor Visual Studio Code for any of the languages used in this course. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Python
To write Python code in Visual Studio Code you will need two things:  
1. The Python [interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/) which is the program that reads and executes Python code one line at a time. Downloading the latest version will do.
2. The Python extension for Visual Studio Code. It can be found in the Extensions panel of the editor, located on the left sidebar (or you can press Ctrl + Shift + X). Search for Python and you will find the official extension by Microsoft at the top of the list. 

## JavaScript
JavaScript support is built in to Visual Studio Code so it is possible to write JavaScript code and run it right away. 


## C#



## Rust
