# Strings

A string is a type of data that holds zero or more text characters. In programming languages strings are denoted in quotes. Most allow either single  `''` or double `""` quotes for strings, though some reserve single quotes for single characters. On the other hand, some programmers prefer using single over double quotes for strings because it feels less noisy. Unfortunately, there is not a whole lot of consistency in this matter. To be safe, I suggest writing single characters in single quotes e.g. `'s'` and anything longer in doubles e.g. `"string"`.
