# Working with Different Types of Data


## Booleans

True or not true? That's exactly what boolean values are about: a value that is either `true` or `false`.

## Strings


### Samples - String Interpolation
```javascript
var age = 5;

console.log(`Jimmy is ${age} years old`);
console.log(`Angie is ${age} years old`);
```

The samples thus far were written in the JavaScript programming language. Let's look at some other ones and see how they differ.

Python
```python
age = 5

print(f'Jimmy is {age} years old')
print(f'Angie is {age} years old')
```

C#
```csharp
int age = 5;

Console.WriteLine($"Jimmy is {age} years old");
Console.WriteLine($"Angie is {age} years old");
```

Rust
```rust
let age: i32 = 5;

println!("Jimmy is {} years old", age);
println!("Angie is {} years old", age);
```
