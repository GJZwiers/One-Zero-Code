# Installing an Editor

> Coming soon

To create a program the first thing you'll need, computer aside, is a place to write the code. Although you could write code in something as simple as Notepad, it is generally more helpful to use an **editor**. Using an editor makes life easier because it comes with features to help you write code faster and in a more organized way.  
Depending on the language you are working with you may also need a program that makes the code runnable: a **compiler**. This type of program translates the code of a particular language to binary instructions for the computer's central processing unit (CPU).  
Often you will want to use a **debugger** to perform a test-run of a program at various moments to see if everything is working as expected. In basic applications debugging can be achieved simply by running the program and viewing the outputs on a console window, to check if the desired results are there. However, for larger applications, where many variables and components are interacting, the use of a debugger becomes more important.

The three parts of a developer's toolkit described above are often bundled together in something called an _Integrated Development Environment_ (**IDE**). Using an IDE for a specific language is helpful because it tends to allow faster coding, better debugging as well as the use of advanced language-specific features, such as code autocompletion and built-in refactoring options. Examples: Anaconda (Python IDE), IntelliJ (Java IDE)

Another approach is to use an extensible editor that can work as a fully-fledged IDE by installing extensions of choice. Such an editor will have basic support for most languages but features such as debugging will need to be installed separately. Visual Studio Code is an example of this type of editor.
