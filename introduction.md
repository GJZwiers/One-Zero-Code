# Introduction

Hello and welcome to One Zero Code. The aim of this course is to provide a fully-featured, cross-language course on computer programming at both practical and conceptual levels. This means it does not focus on a single programming language but instead describes and shows the core characteristics of nearly all in use today. The reason is that modern languages are converging to a major extent and the use-cases for many are opening up. Nowadays, you can write desktop software in browser-based language and more traditionally 'offline' oriented languages have very good integration with the web. 

In addition, computer hardware is powerful and plentiful and considerations of efficiency arise only for the most demanding sofware such as next-generation gaming, scientific simulation, 3D animation and virtual reality.

Present-day development is about getting things done. On the other hand, sticking to a single programming language helps while learning to code because it reduces mental noise. Therefore I do recommend to practice your code in a language of your choice. However, in this book you will find examples in various languages that each have made different trade-offs, some choosing for very lightweight syntax and style (think Python) while others being more verbose but giving much more control over code (think Rust).

The learning goals of this course are:
- To understand programming concepts across languages
- To get knowledge about good habits and practices when coding programs

## Scope
The world of computers is a rather large one and this book cannot hope to explain everything. It covers most of the software domain, discussing code at both high and low levels. Where needed hardware considerations are described as well, for example the memory use of certain data types.
