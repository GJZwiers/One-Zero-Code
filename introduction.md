# Introduction

Welcome to One Zero Code! This course aims to provide a fully-featured, cross-language guide on computer programming at conceptual level. This means it does not focus on a single programming language but instead describes and shows the core characteristics of nearly all in use today. The reason is that modern languages are converging to a major extent while the use-cases for many are widening. Nowadays, you can write desktop software in browser-based language and more traditionally 'offline' oriented languages have very good integration with the web of today.  
In addition, computer hardware is powerful and plentiful and considerations of efficiency arise only for the most demanding sofware such as next-generation gaming, scientific simulation, 3D animation and virtual reality.

Present-day development is about getting things done. On the other hand, sticking to a single programming language helps while learning to code because it reduces mental noise. Therefore, I do recommend practicing code in the language of your choice. However, in this book you will find examples in various languages that each have made different trade-offs, some choosing for very lightweight syntax and style (think Python) while others add more verbosity in exchange for more fine-grained control over code (think Rust).

The learning goals of this course are:
- To understand the major programming concepts across languages
- To apply good habits and practices when coding programs in terms of readability and clarity
- To gain understanding of what happens under the hood when compiling and running programs.
